	Msg1 <You should not have come here, outsider. The wastes will devour your bones!>
	Msg2 <Are you working on realizing the dream of the prophet?>
	Msg3 <You have recovered the lost scepter of the founder! Surely you are the one of whom the legends speak... Have you come to fulfil the prophecy?>
	Msg4 <In the days of the exodus, in the final days of the founder, a great stone was erected in this place. Upon it was inscribed the last prophecy of the founder, and the promise that some day a hero would arrive to fulfil what was written.>
	Msg5 <It may be that you are correct, and all we have waited for is a lie... But what choice do we have other than to wait?>
	Msg6 <The prophecy promised that at the time of the hero: our enemies will be made to suffer for what they have done to us, our land shall grow fat and prosperous, and Clan Ironwind will reign supreme over all!>
	Msg7 <It's not a literal translation, true, but you have to understand the will of the founder. These things have to be taken in context.>
	Msg8 <Are you saying that you're willing to give up your past life, to dedicate yourself entirely to Clan Ironwind and follow the path of the prophecy?>
	Msg9 <The hero of legend must be dedicated entirely to our clan, with all the responsibility that entails.>
	Msg10 <It is one thing to say you are a hero, but quite another to prove it. I will induct you into the clan. Your first task shall be the punishment of our foes.>
	Msg11 <All conflict shall end once Clan Ironwind has completely subdued our enemies. We shall start with Clan Markheim...>
	Msg12 <Our land shall be made green and prosperous. For this, I think it is obvious that we will need water... There has been talk of capturing a desalination plant from our enemies. See what you can find about this.>
	Msg13 <The ancient wrongs shall be righted. Many years ago the band of the Scorcher Khan stole an artifact of great value from us. You must recover this treasure, then kill every man in the Khan's camp.>
	Msg14 <You joined Clan Ironwind to fulfil their prophecy.>
	Msg15 <The prophecy was fulfilled, to the benefit of Clan Ironwind.>
	Msg16 <The prophecy was fulfilled with the destruction of Clan Ironwind.>
	Msg17 <You have finally done it, the prophecy has been fulfilled... what fools we have been...>
	Msg18 <While you were away our enemies attacked. They destroyed everything... killed everyone... Clan Ironwind shall have no more enemies to fight, because the Clan is no more... The words of the founder have been our undoing. Your work is done.>
	Msg19 <All three of the prophecies have been fulfilled. The wrongs of the past have been righted, the land has been made green, and we have made peace with our enemies. I doubted you, but you are undoubtedly truly the hero of legend!>
	Msg20 <The ring of the founder has been returned to IronWind, though the Scorcher Khan has not been sufficiently punished. The people will begin to doubt you if you show weakness like this again.>
	Msg21 <Good... our revenge upon the Clan of the Scorcher Khan is complete. Next, we must begin >
	Msg22 <If you show mercy to your enemies it's likely to get us all killed. You must forget the ways of the greenzone if you are to survive here... but no matter, the first part of the prophecy has been fulfilled.>
	Msg23 <Your heart is soft, like that of the other greenzoners... but no matter, the first part of the prophecy has been fulfilled.>
	Msg24 <The lands are to be made green again. For this, we are going to need water... There was some talk earlier of capturing a desalination plant from our enemies. See what you can find.>
	Msg25 <The second part of the prophecy has been fulfilled... Now, it's time for the final stage: Ironwind Fortress shall fight no more, once all our enemies have been annihilated.>

	Prompt1 <That's right, I'm the guy of legend.>
	Prompt2 <What's all this prophecy nonsense about?>
	Prompt3 <A hero? That's me.>
	Prompt4 <Sounds like a load of bull.>
	Prompt5 <What did this prophecy say?>
	Prompt6 <I don't think that's really what it says.>
	CPrompt6 <ifG PCSkillVal 34 4 Accept>
	Prompt7 <If it's a hero you need, I'm here.>
	Prompt8 <Wait, that sounds a bit heavy...>
	Prompt9 <Yes, that's what I'm saying.>
	Prompt10 <What am I supposed to be doing?>
	Prompt11 <What do you mean!? Where is everyone?>
	Prompt12 <I am sorry for failing.>
	Prompt13 <I won't destroy an entire village for revenge.>
	Prompt14 <So what's next?>
